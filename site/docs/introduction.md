**LocalSlip** is local DNS for ports. A name owns a TCP number on this machine. You still type the port.

**localhost** is the machine; **LocalSlip** is the slip.

You start a Svelte app. Vite takes **5173**. You start a second one. It takes **5174**. After a reboot you start them in the other order. The ports swap. Bookmarks, firewall rules, and the phone now hit the wrong app.

Name the port so that does not happen. `foo` stays on 5173. `bar` stays on 5174. An agent or the app asks the CLI instead of hoping Vite picked the same number again.

## What it is

- Named leases persist on the machine that ran the CLI (`~/.localslip/`)
- `localslip get foo` prints only the port, for scripts
- A dashboard on **54321** shows leases and what is listening
- `--lan` binds `0.0.0.0` and syncs an inbound firewall allow on Windows, macOS, and Linux

It is **not** a reverse proxy. It does not give you `foo.localhost` URLs.

## Two surfaces

| npm `localslip` | The CLI and dashboard, on your machine |

The domain never serves leases.

[LocalHelm](https://localhelm.dev) hosts start and stop on the Ports tab. Claim, release, and firewall stay on this CLI.
